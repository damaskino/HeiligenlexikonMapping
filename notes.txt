Assumptions about terms:
Basically there are three elements in each term, only the name, the first term, is guaranteed to appear.
Otherwise it can be a combination of all three or 1st+2nd and 1st+3rd

First Element is the name of the saint, some terms only have the name as a single element

Second Element the "level of holiness" aka the canonization status S. B. V. or variations thereof, like S.S. and V.V.

Third element if it exists: if it's in brackets and contains a number is the n-th saint of the same name

There is some variation how these are separated. If a canonization is present, it is separated by a comma.

#To verify/check
Is the name always a single word? - Nope, see Johannes Vogelsang, Johannes de Palafox, try comma as separator instead
How many saints are, S, B, V or have no canonization status?
Is there a strong correlation between canonization status and the amount of text in the entry?


Are these jobs?
Presb.,
Erem.->Eremit = Hermit, debatable

There are some errors where Mai) is Mail most likely an error in the source data

- Optional: Look for potential alternative for determining gender, stanza is very resource hungry for something that should only amount to a dict lookup
-"auch" and hi rend italics could be a possible markers - DONE

-check how fuzzy ratio is determined -DONE
it boils down to 1-(Levenshtein/(len(string1)+len(string2))) and making a rounded percentage of that

-when done, stratified random sampling for 100 entries
    - length of article
    --> need to add length of article - DONE

d3e100677Heiligenlexikon-1858 Basilius
First result is another Basilius (feast days don't match up)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilius_der_Gro%C3%9Fe

Googling 23rd may
brings up this:
https://web.archive.org/web/20111012033504/http://breviary.net/martyrology/mart05/mart0523.htm
it also mentions  S. Epictitus (Epitacius), though it's not clear from the lex entry what their relation was, the web page states

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_23_(Eastern_Orthodox_liturgics)#cite_note-ROMAN-12
Here it mentions Basileus as the Bishop of Braga, who seems to have lived 60-95
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Braga#List_of_Bishops_of_Braga
He doesn't have his own page but he is listed in the list of bishops of Braga
Under the name Basilo(!), the date matches, but it is Portugal and not Spain as mentioned in the article
--> Saint doesn't even seem to have his own page in German wikipedia
--> Didn't find him under Basilius, but the regional equivalent Basilo
--> Different country, possible mixup?
https://www.wikiwand.com/pt/Bas%C3%ADlio_de_Braga Death date matches, but birth date is earlier?
https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas%C3%ADlio_de_Braga
Portuguese Wiki has some more info

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_de_Romans
-->Feast day is off by one day, 22nd instaed of 23rd on wikipedia, birthplace doesnt match, Wiki says Izernore, Lex says Lyon
Death date matches, both mention 32 years as archbishop,
Lex: father also bernard, mother Helirda
Wiki: Father is Heliarde

Okay in this case the entry refers to another entry which is also the same person, huh

limit Birthdate cutoff after end of publishing date of lexicon
2 versions: 1 with humans, 1 with saints (has canonization status)
