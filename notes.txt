Assumptions about terms:
Basically there are three elements in each term, only the name, the first term, is guaranteed to appear.
Otherwise it can be a combination of all three or 1st+2nd and 1st+3rd

First Element is the name of the saint, some terms only have the name as a single element

Second Element the "level of holiness" aka the canonization status S. B. V. or variations thereof, like S.S. and V.V.

Third element if it exists: if it's in brackets and contains a number is the n-th saint of the same name

There is some variation how these are separated. If a canonization is present, it is separated by a comma.

#To verify/check
Is the name always a single word? - Nope, see Johannes Vogelsang, Johannes de Palafox, try comma as separator instead
How many saints are, S, B, V or have no canonization status?
Is there a strong correlation between canonization status and the amount of text in the entry?
