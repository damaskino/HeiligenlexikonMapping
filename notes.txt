Assumptions about terms:
Going off the simple whitespace split for each term:


First Element is the name of the saint, 

Second Element "level of holiness" S. B. V. or variations thereof, like S.S. and V.V.

Third element if it exists: if it's in brackets and contains a number is the n-th saint of the same name





#To verify
Is the name always a single word?
